# Recursion

Fibonacci was an Italian mathematician who lived around 1200 A.D..
He devised a sequence of numbers, called the Fibonacci-numbers which can easily expressed
as a "meervoudig functievoorschrift". We do not need to understand the implications, need or even mathematics.

We should however be able to translate this into a recursive JavaScript function.

<pre>
          /
          | 0, for n = 0
          |
fib(n) = <  1, for n = 1
          |
          | fib(n-1) + fib(n-2), else
          \
</pre>

For bigger numbers, this solution is correct but too slow.
Write a second version `fibFast` that uses a loop rather than recursion.
**Hint:** Search the internet for help.
**Hint:** Skip this *fast* exercise if you are running behind!
